#' iqtigfunctions: IQTIG Specific Functions for Public Reporting
#'
#' The goal of iqtig.lang is to provide an implementation of IQTIG specific R
#' functions as e.g. used in the published indicator specifications (QIDB). For a
#' detailed, technical reference please use the `help` function, or take a look
#' at the IQTIG R readme (in German), distributed with the QIDB.
#'
#' Please also take note of \code{vignette("qskh_qidb", package =
#' "iqtigfunctions")}, which showcases how you can import a QSKH
#' QIDB Microsoft Access Database and apply the computational rules of various
#' indicators to a dataset.
#'
#' For any feedback, ideas or bug reports, please do not hesitate to contact the
#' maintainer.
